Curve fitting for 1D vector with any given model equations.

Developped and test on softer versions
MATLAB 2014b
Windows 10 

1. in folder jcfit_L1
    run jcfit_L1_test.m

2. in folder jcfit_L2
    run jcfittest.m

Both are the same code using different panelty term:
1. L1 minimize absolute sum of residual, i.e. least absolute sum of variation 
2. L2 minimize sum of square of residual, i.e. least square regression

Thery both have different strengths for different problems.

change your fitting model in the function 'mdl' in 'jcfitf.m' (moved to older versions 11/2021) if you use custom functions for complicated model or global fitting.

A semi-exhaustive and brutal searching algorithm using the least-square method to find the best fit of a curve. The least-square mehtod can be changed easily to other residual treatment methods.

The fitting time of each iterature is scaled with the number of parameters of the fitting, the search speed is not verysensitive to the accuracy because the exponential searching spacing design. Each parameter is searched one by one within its boundaries. Thus a P^N question is reduced to PN with a cost of losing space coverage.

The code can be changed to fit multiple curves globally by introducing different modles for different curves using the same parameters.
